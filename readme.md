## guidelines to use
* after filling the form, the **mark attendance button** signs up the user if the user hasnt been signed up yet
* if the user has signed up before, the program only increments the work days by 1
* if you click the **Check earnings accrued** button, it displays the total amount of money earned for every time he/she came to work.
* note that the earnings is based on the salary of  10,000 naira per month. you can change it but its embedded in the code
       >move to the attendance.php and scroll till you find the **$salary** variable and change the one with **10000** to whatever  you want
* db_conn is situated at a different file to allow for easy migration and configuration to another server
